# Introduction

IBApi.Execution and IBApi.CommissionReport can be requested on demand via the IBApi.EClient.reqExecutions method which receives a IBApi.ExecutionFilter object as parameter to obtain only those executions matching the given criteria. An empty IBApi.ExecutionFilter object can be passed to obtain all previous executions.

Once all matching executions have been delivered, an IBApi.EWrapper.execDetailsEnd event will be triggered.

Important: By default, only those executions occurring since midnight for that particular account will be delivered. If you want to request executions from the last 7 days, TWS's Trade Log setting "Show trades for …" must be adjusted to your requirement. The IB Gateway is limited to only executions from the current trading day since midnight.
